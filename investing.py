investing.py -- non-US, non-Korean companies: Investing.com earnings-call transcripts
                -> transcripts/investing/*.txt

Who this is for: the 88 names in company_metadata.json listed in Taiwan, Japan, Europe, HK,
China (Quanta, Wiwynn, Alchip, MediaTek, Tokyo Electron, Infineon, ASMPT ...). They hold
quarterly investor calls but publish no written transcript, and no free API carries them
(Alpha Vantage = US only, defeatbeta = US only, MOPS blocks file downloads). Investing.com
does transcribe the English calls and posts them as articles within ~a day. Verified on
Alchip Q2 2026: ~18,000 words, every speaker turn, full analyst Q&A.

Same interface as dart.py / av.py:

    python investing.py sync                # search Investing.com for each of OUR companies,
                                            #   download every transcript not saved yet
    python investing.py fetch <url>         # one article by hand (company/quarter read from title)
    python investing.py pending / done      # the enrichment queue

How the fetch works, and the honest caveat
------------------------------------------
Investing.com sits behind a bot filter that rejects plain `requests` (HTTP 403). The
`curl_cffi` library sends the request with a real Chrome TLS fingerprint, which the site
accepts like a normal browser visit. We read public article pages only, one page per second,
for personal research -- but it is scraping, and Investing.com's T&C do not grant an API.
If they block it one day, the fallback is the Chrome extension (open the article, copy
the text) under the same label.

Label: `[Company] Q[N] FY[YYYY] (MM-DD-YYYY)` with the ARTICLE publish date (the call is
usually the same day or the day before). Quarter/year come from the article title
("Earnings call transcript: Alchip Q2 2026 ..."); FY = the year in the title.

Conferences (fireside chats at Goldman Communacopia, Citi TMT, UBS, ...)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Investing.com also posts a same-day article per conference appearance, titled
"<Company> at <Conference> <YYYY>: <summary>". The first ~2,000 words are an editorial
summary; after the paragraph "Full transcript - ..." comes the verbatim fireside chat with
speaker labels ("Shannon Cross, Executive, HPE: ..."). Verified on HPE at Goldman
Communacopia 2026-09-10: 8,195 words, 6,081 of them transcript. The site search cannot
find these reliably, so `conferences` walks the /news/transcripts listing pages instead
(36 articles per page, publish date in the page JSON) and stops at --since.

    python investing.py conferences             # every company in company_metadata.json (US too),
                                                #   last 180 days -> transcripts/conferences/*.txt
    python investing.py conferences --since 2026-06-01 --pages 400
    python investing.py fetch <url>             # a conference URL is recognised by its title

Only the transcript part is saved (the summary is dropped). Label follows the enrich skill's
Event format `[Company] [Event] [YYYY] (MM-DD-YYYY)`, e.g.
`HPE Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference 2026 (09-10-2026)`.
Every run is recorded in investing/conferences_state.json (when, pages walked, oldest
article date reached, files saved) so you can see how far back each run went.
