"""
enrich_status.py — the enrichment PIPELINE dashboard behind the web app's Coverage tab.

The Coverage tab already answers "which COMPANY should I enrich next?". This module
answers the other half: "which PIPELINE ran when, what did it cover, what is still missing?"

For every pipeline (enrich us / dart / intl / tw / edgar / conference, plus the manual
`Transcript:<company>` pastes) it reads what is already on disk — no new bookkeeping:

  * the pipeline's state files   (av/sync_state.json, dart/sync_state.json, ...)  -> last sync, waiting list
  * the pipeline's pending queue (av/pending.json, investing/pending.json, ...)  -> what is NOT yet enriched
  * its transcript folder        (transcripts/av/*.txt, ...)                      -> what was fetched, and when
  * the merged graph             (graph/merged_graph.json)                        -> which source labels landed
  * the patch receipts           (patches/applied/*.json)                         -> when each label was enriched

Two outputs:
  graph/enrich_status.json   GENERATED every build (never hand-edit) — read by web/ via `npm run sync`.
  enrich_log.json            APPEND-ONLY record at the repo root, committed. One row per (day, pipeline)
                             whenever the counts change, so the run history survives a fresh clone
                             (file mtimes and patch receipts do not).

Run by graph_build.py after the graph is built; can also be run alone:  python -X utf8 enrich_status.py
