taxonomy.py — the single source of truth for the supply-chain vocabulary.

The project used to model each chain as flow[] -> tier -> players[] using a fixed
bottom-up 10-tier list. That has been replaced by the user's "AI Build Supply Chain"
taxonomy: a TOP-DOWN stack of LAYERS (Application at the top, Critical Minerals at the
bottom), where each layer holds SECTORS (and a few sectors hold SUB-SECTORS), plus four
cross-cutting DOMAINS (power, thermal, security, edge AI) that sit beside the stack.

Everything that needs to know "what are the layers / what color is each / what order do
they go in" imports from here, so the vocabulary lives in ONE place instead of being
copy-pasted across app.py, graph_build.py and main.py.

Data files store SLUGS (the short machine names below) for `layer` and `domain`, and
free strings for `sector` / `sub_sector`. Human-readable display names come from the
tables here.

    A sector holds EITHER `players` directly OR `sub_sectors` (each with `players`).
