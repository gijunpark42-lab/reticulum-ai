### Workflow 2g — Investor-conference fireside chats via Investing.com (`enrich conference`)

Between earnings calls, management speaks at bank conferences (Goldman Communacopia, Citi Global
TMT, Jefferies, UBS, Morgan Stanley TMT, JPM …). Investing.com posts a same-day article per
appearance — an editorial summary followed by the **verbatim fireside chat with speaker labels**
("Bill, CEO, Credo: …"). `investing.py conferences` walks the site's `/news/transcripts` listing
pages (newest first, 36 per page, publish date in the page JSON), keeps only articles whose title
is `<Company> at <Conference> [YYYY]: …` for a company in `company_metadata.json` (**US names
included** — nothing else carries conference talk), saves ONLY the transcript part (summary
dropped) to `transcripts/conferences/`, and queues it in `investing/pending.json` with
`kind: "conference"`. Verified 2026-09-10: Credo, Supermicro, Seagate, Arista, TE Connectivity,
Penguin Solutions, SpaceX, Uber at Goldman/Citi/Jefferies — 5,000–6,600 words each.
Same scraping caveat as `enrich intl` (Chrome TLS fingerprint, one request per second).

**Trigger: the user says `enrich conference` (or `enrich conferences`).** Run the whole loop:

1. `python investing.py conferences` — default window 180 days (`--since YYYY-MM-DD`, `--pages N`
   to walk further; ~1 s per page and per article). It prints how many listing pages it walked,
   the oldest article date reached, and `saved` / `skip` / `FAIL` per article. Every run is
   appended to `investing/conferences_state.json` → `runs[]` (`at`, `since`, `pages`,
   `oldest_seen`, `candidates`, `saved`); `seen{}` maps every conference URL to
   `saved` / `skip` / `fail` (`fail` is retried next run). **Read the last `runs[]` entry first** — it
   tells you how far back the site has already been walked, so you know whether the queue is
   complete for the window. The bot filter answers 403 after ~130 fast listing pages (first
   backfill 2026-09-10 stopped at `oldest_seen` 2026-08-06 with 84 files saved); `get()` now waits
   a minute and retries, but if a run still stops short, re-run later — it skips what it has and
   keeps walking back.
2. `python investing.py pending` — rows whose first column is `conference` are this workflow's
   queue (rows marked `transcript` belong to `enrich intl` — leave them). Never enrich a file
   that is not in the queue.
3. **Enrich each file under the depth rule below** (Workflow 2, JOB 1–5, ADD-only, patches only).
4. `python graph_build.py --sync` — ONE run by the coordinator after all patches are in. It applies
   the patches and runs `verify_graph.py` on the labels just applied.
5. **Verification loop:** read every `[fail]` / `[warn]` line. For each `[fail]`, re-open the
   transcript file, decide whether the entry is wrong (fix or drop it) or the locator is wrong
   (fix the `source_quote` / label), re-run `python -X utf8 verify_graph.py --label "<label>"`,
   and repeat until the labels from this run show 0 fail. Warnings that are explainable (e.g.
   a number the speaker rounds differently) are listed in the report, not silenced.
6. `python investing.py done --kind conference` (keeps the `enrich intl` rows).
7. Report per company: label, what was added, what was skipped as a restatement, verify result.
   Then **update memory** (`conference_enrichment.md` in this project's memory dir): run date,
   window walked (`oldest_seen`), the companies + conferences enriched, the ones skipped as
   restatements, open problems. The user wants to be able to ask "where did we get to?" later.
If the queue is empty after step 1, say so and stop.

**Depth rule — only what the earnings call did not already say.** A fireside chat two weeks after
a call restates most of the call. Before extracting, read the company's most recent earnings
entry in the graph (`quarterly_data` under its latest `[Company] Q[N] FY[YYYY] (…)` label —
`python -X utf8 verify_graph.py --label` prints it, or grep `graph/merged_graph.json`). ADD only:
- new or changed numbers (guidance raised/lowered, a quarter-to-date data point, backlog, capacity,
  ramp timing, pricing, mix) — not the call's numbers repeated;
- newly *named* customers, suppliers, partners, design wins, contracts → `contracts` on the existing
  edge (new edge only if the speaker states the relationship explicitly);
- product/generation transitions, supply constraints, share shifts the call did not mention.
If nothing survives the rule, write NO patch; list the file in the report as
`restates <earnings label>` and mark it done. Questions are context only — a moderator's number is
not management's unless management confirms it. Only management speakers are sources
(`Name, CEO/CFO/…, Company:` paragraphs); nothing from the article's own summary (it is not saved).

**Label:** the `# source label:` line verbatim — the enrich skill's Event format
`[Company] [Conference] [YYYY] (MM-DD-YYYY)`, e.g. `Credo Goldman Sachs conference 2026 (09-10-2026)`.
The date is the article publish date, which is the event day. `[Company]` is the canonical node name.

**Multi-agent (when the queue has more than ~5 rows) — the recipe that worked for `enrich edgar`:**
- Coordinator splits the `conference` rows by company into ≤ 8 batches (all of one company's
  conferences in one batch so the depth rule is applied consistently).
- One **enricher** agent per batch: reads each transcript in full, applies the depth rule, writes
  only `patches/conf_<file stem>.json` — never `chains/` (see `concurrent_job_race` memory).
- One **verifier** agent per batch, adversarial: re-reads every transcript, checks that every
  number, name and claim in the patch appears verbatim in a management paragraph and is not a
  restatement of the call entry; edits or deletes patch entries; never adds.
- Coordinator then runs step 4 once, does the verification loop (step 5), steps 6–7.

**File format** `transcripts/conferences/<company slug>_<conference slug>_<YYYY-MM-DD>.txt`:
`SOURCE:` (article URL) / `TITLE:` / `EVENT:` / `DATE:` / `# source label:` / `# speakers:` (the
management speakers found) / `# paragraphs:` header, then one paragraph per turn —
`Moderator: …` and `Name, Title, Company: …`. A `# note: no 'Full transcript' marker` header means
the article had no summary/transcript split and the whole body was saved; enrich the speaker
paragraphs only. Manual pull of one article: `python investing.py fetch <url>` (a non-earnings
transcripts URL is routed here automatically).

**Coverage reality:** titles name the company the way Investing.com writes it (`Supermicro`,
`Credo`, `Arista`); `match_company` uses the same spellings/aliases as `enrich intl`, so a company
that keeps being missed needs an `ALIASES` entry in `investing.py`, not a hand paste.
