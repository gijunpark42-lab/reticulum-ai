evidence.py — "show me where this number comes from".

Every quarterly_data entry and every contract in graph/merged_graph.json carries a
source label ("NVIDIA Q2 FY2027 (08-26-2026)"). verify_graph.py already checks, per
entry, whether that label resolves to a file on disk and whether the entry's numbers
appear in it. This script goes one step further, for the web app: it finds the actual
PASSAGE in the source text that backs each entry and saves a short excerpt of it, so a
reader can click a data point in the node panel and see the sentence it came from.

Nothing here is written by a model. It is plain text search, so it is deterministic:
the same graph + the same transcripts always give the same evidence.json.

What it writes
--------------
graph/evidence.json  (copied to web/public/data/ by `npm run sync`, fetched lazily by
web/src/components/Evidence.tsx):

    { "generated": "2026-09-05",
      "entries": {
        "<key>": { "doc":     "transcripts/av/nvidia_q3_2027.txt",   # null when no_source
                   "excerpt": "…context «$57 billion» context…",     # null when nothing found
                   "matched": "$57 billion",                          # the text inside «…»
                   "status":  "found" | "no_match" | "no_source",
                   "via":     "number" | "phrase" | "words" | "counterparty" | null,
                   "unmatched": ["45", "3.2"] }   # optional: figure numbers absent from the doc
      } }

key = first 16 hex characters of sha1("<kind>|<company>|<target>|<label>|<signal>"),
UTF-8 encoded, where
    kind    = "qd" for a node's quarterly_data entry, "contract" for an edge contract
    company = the node id (for a contract: the edge SOURCE company)
    target  = the edge TARGET company ("" for qd)
    label   = the entry's `quarter` (qd) / `source` (contract) label, exactly as stored
    signal  = the entry's `signal` text, exactly as stored
web/src/lib/evidence.ts builds the identical key in the browser, so the page can look
an entry up without shipping company names or signal text twice.

How the excerpt is chosen
-------------------------
1. SOURCE  — resolve the label to a file exactly the way verify_graph.py does (its
             resolver is imported, not copied). No file on disk -> status "no_source".
2. NUMBERS — take every number written in figure / units / value (verify_graph.numbers_in;
             years and single digits are ignored there, dates like "08-14-2026" here). Look
             each one up in the document: exact ("24.8"), trailing-zero ("14.0" ~ "14"),
             rounded ("88.9" ~ 88.86), and unit-rescaled ("1.898" B ~ "1,898" M; "150.3" KRW B
             ~ a filing's "150,323" 백만원) — the same four ways verify_graph's Doc.has_number
             accepts a number, but position-aware, so we know WHERE it is. Every occurrence is
             scored: distinctive words of the signal within ±220 characters ("distinctive" =
             rare across the whole transcript corpus, an IDF weight) + how specific the matched
             token is (a bare "48" proves little, "150,323" a lot). Best total wins. Numbers
             present but none found -> "no_match" (the nearest passage found through step 3
             is still attached as context).
3. WORDING — if the entry has no number, look for the signal's wording instead: the
             highest-scoring run of 4-6 consecutive signal words that occurs in the document
             (stopwords do not count towards the score), then 3- and 2-word phrases, then a
             single rare word that has another signal word within the same ±220 window,
             then the name of the counterparty (the other company on the edge, or the
             Korean alias of it inside a DART filing). Nothing -> "no_match".
4. EXCERPT — verbatim source text (only runs of whitespace are collapsed to one space),
             ±220 characters around the match, cut on word boundaries, the match wrapped
             in «…», "…" marking a cut edge.

How to run
----------
    python evidence.py                                   # full build -> graph/evidence.json
    python evidence.py --label "SK Hynix Q2 FY2026 (08-14-2026)"   # print those entries only
    python evidence.py --company Vistra                  # print entries touching a company
graph_build.py calls build_evidence(graph) right after derive_all(graph), so the file is
fresh on every build (and `--sync` copies it into web/public/data).
